An implementation of Suffix Array using induced sorting with simple search and search using lcp array. Also an implementation of Naive (brute-force) algorithm.
The implementation was tested on building time. For SA it means building suffix array and lcp array. For naive algorithm it means only some preprocessing (linear passage).
All three algorithm was tested on five corpora: a few paragraphs of Lorem ipsum (small), first chapter of first book of Harry Potter by J. K. Rowling (harry), an entire book of 20000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne and two random DNA sequences (dna, dna_large). All graph shows mean value as circle and minimum and maximum as whiskers.
